# VLC Media player to view m3u URLs

*Before proceeding, please note that no video files is stored by me, or the iptv-org repository. To my understanding, the links are displaying publicly available streaming content that is not saved / stored. At the time of writing, this is a paraphrasing of what is posted within the readme file on their repo. If you feel the need to learn more, see their [Legal](#legal) section, and [FAQ](#faq)  that I pasted for convenience. However, I do not maintain this document. To access their most up to date details, please see thier repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/).*

### Example Links that (should work) without any fuss:

- https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/us.m3u
- https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/languages/eng.m3u
- https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/uk.m3u


### For a massive list of all available channels: 

- https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/index.m3u


 *The base url below can also be used to look for new link through the github repository's public github pages site. (Github's free hosting service).*

- https://iptv-org.github.io/ 


# Advanced
### For dev/research/etc. 

* Navigating the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/) will lead you to more links you may use. I included the "read me" file from the repo below -- which contains "how to" / "FAQ" / and other nice to know things.


* Cloning the repository

    - If you are familiar with using a terminal / command line interface, have a Github account with the proper credentials stored, you may want to "clone" the repo to your local computer. This will give you access to what files are online on your own computer instead of having to go to the GitHub again.

    - They also provide access to tools that can be explored for creating your own m3u links and other things. 
    
        - [More from the IPTV Github](https://github.com/iptv-org/)

    - Otherwise, you can also download the repository and others posted on their GitHub as a zip file.  Either way, this will only provide the files that can be run with the proper development environment set up. 


Example of command to clone a repo using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Free-TV/IPTV.git
```
#### Link to the [IPTV repo](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/) - which will be updated and maintained by developers and other users of the service. 

*read me as of 10/xx/2024*: note that most links not link properly, please check out the readme in the original repo for working links!

## Legal

No video files are stored in this repository. The repository simply contains user-submitted links to publicly available video stream URLs, which to the best of our knowledge have been intentionally made publicly by the copyright holders. If any links in these playlists infringe on your rights as a copyright holder, they may be removed by sending a [pull request](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/pulls) or opening an [issue](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/issues/new?assignees=freearhey&labels=removal+request&template=--removal-request.yml&title=Remove%3A+). However, note that we have **no control** over the destination of the link, and just removing the link from the playlist will not remove its contents from the web. Note that linking does not directly infringe copyright because no copy is made on the site providing the link, and thus this is **not** a valid reason to send a DMCA notice to GitHub. To remove this content from the web, you should contact the web host that's actually hosting the content (**not** GitHub, nor the maintainers of this repository).
